#### Life in the Past
Leifr Funahjarta, son of [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], is also a [[Dragonborn|Golden Dragonborn]] and thus is of an ancestry of fire. This fire, too, burns as passion for all that he does. It is well known across the island of [[Q'ba]] that Leifr is a friend to all, and this is further enforced by his following of [[Tamara]] as a Cleric of the [[Domains of The Four|Life Domain]], where he has earned considerable skill as a healer. Though noble-born his intention toward commonfolk has earned him great respect, just as his father before him. 

With his [[Dragonborn|Draconic Ancestry]] tied to the element of fire and religious roots set in [[Tamara|Tamara's]] [[Domains of The Four|Domain]] much of Leifr's time is spent travelling between the forest of [[Dimmafall]] and [[The Desert]], as well as in [[Drakenholm]] and [[Kin's Landing]]. It is in these places he spends most of his time and most closely follows religious events, ceremonies and worship. These locations, too, are the places where he is most known by the people, some of whom he has formed a strong connection with in spite of social standing. 

Since the rule of [[Francis Roberts|King Francis Roberts]] Leifr's public visibility has reduced significantly, he has not been seen at all within the last 2 years. It is known that during the time leading up to his disappearence he was known to provide support, both medically and financially, to those who need it, whether [[Dragonborn]], [[Human]] or [[Non-Human List]]. His non-preferential treatment of all races left some treating him with distain, whether they considered themselves to be aligned with [[The Crown]] or otherwise.


#### Life in the Present
Leifr is a Golden Dragonborn just like his father, [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]]. The noble you know him to be has been weathered down. The clothes he wears align with that of a common born, there are no distinguishing features save for it's green colour and tattered look. Though his clothes look uninspiring, this is not the same for his face, for his amber eyes smoulder with passion and a glint of wisdom. 

He carries with him a staff of a plain, dark wood which is only adorned with the symbol of [[Tamara]] - a 7 pronged white star, one of which is an elongated tail, reaching up through a black night sky.

A cleric of the Life domain, he is a devout follower of [[Tamara]] despite his affinity to fire through ancestry. Because of this, much of his time is spent in the south and western parts of the island, as well as [[Kin's Landing]] and [[Drakenholm]].
