# Act 1: Introduction

**Part 1**
It is Winter. #calendar #wip 
(choose a PC), you stand on the side of a cliff, looking over the edge. Below you you watch the harsh waves, crashing against the base of the cliffs, it must be more than 50ft to the water below. "Are we all ready then? I'm glad you all got my message."says Commander Leifr, the leader of the rebel group, of which you are a lieutenant. You turn back, the (number of players) of you all nod, in near unison. "Sorry there's been no time for pleasantries, let's get this operation up and running and we'll all get merry around a fire and exchange a story or two, yeah?". 

A small band of mishmash militia stands off to one side, 2 burly looking very young Dragonborn males, a slightly older Green Dragonborn Male, a middle-aged Halfling female, and a young looking female Dwarf are all looking away from you, chatting to one another quietly. Though they are wearing outfits that coordinate with one another, it is clearly a very roughly put together idea of a uniform, nonetheless it seems to be a message the (number) of you clearly didn't receive. The group stand next to a small stock of general supplies, "I brought these guys along, don't worry they are well trusted, if a bit green around the edges."

(Another PC), looking ahead of you, you see a craggy cavern mouth, starting very narrow at the top and slightly widening as it approaches the floor, it is about 10ft tall, but it would be a squeeze yo get through for most. Looking you appear to be standing infront of what may have once been some form of religious building, but carved into the face of the cliff itself. Barely can you make out that there even are markings from here, let alone what they are due to the salty air eroding the face over time. It's no wonder this location is unknown, from the sea behind you or the clifftop above this would be nearly invisible. "Hey, come on, no man left behind!" Commander Leifr calls back to you. In your thoughts you didn't realise the group had started moving into the cavern.

**Part 2:***
One by one you each clamber through the cave mouth (Dexterity: DC5, failed rolls cause only a surface scratch, critical fails lose 1hp)

It is dark inside

***Inside the cliffside, a space has been carved, probably a room for some sort of ceremony. It is large enough for a small crowd to be able to gather, but certainly not large enough to be roomy. Nearest the entry point the stone floor is damaged and rough, but it appears to smooth out as you get further into the room. 
Stone pillars, are regular through the room, or at least crumbled rock where they used to stand are, in some cases. It appears they were likely quite ornate a great many years ago now, but any carvings that once were have been eroded by time.
In the far end of the room there appears to be a large metal dish, some small branches and logs appear to have been placed within, like a makeshift brazier. 

***High Perception check (impossible) in darkness, (15) if torches are lit creating dim light, (10) if torches are lit alongside night vision - to spot a balcony on an upper level 20ft high up which looks over the hall the characters are in, it has a doorway about 10ft wide.


<u>Updated Encounter</u>

Leifr, with lit torch, should naturally head towards the brazier at the end of the room with the intention of lighting it. Go round in a circle to allow the players to explore the room a little using the HQ map for the initial vist for reference of what they can find as they move around the room. Once everyone has taken a short "turn" Leifr should light the Brazier.

If anyone else lights the Brazier during their exploration this ends the exploration and begins the 'cutscene'.

**As the fire begins to burn the room slowly glows from the crackling embers. You start getting a better view of the room you're in as the fire grows, starting out small but eventually growing into a ferocious flame. -show room map - You hear the crackling of the flame continue to build to a grumbling roar. Except no, that roar wasn't from the fire, it was from elsewhere, higher in the building.**

**As the light breaches a balcony 20ft up, a large, serpentine monstrosity emerges from the aperture. (Roll nature, DC15 for knowing the creature as a [[Behir.png]]) It screeches as it begins to run down the wall, you know this is not a beast you could stand a chance facing. The monstrosity charges toward whoever is closest**

Leifr lifts his staff out in front of him and grabs hold of a pouch on his hip, shouting *SOLSTRÃ…LE* (sol-strole-ey), at which point a beam of blinding, radiant light blasts out from his hand, the beam completely engulfs the monstrosity (The behir takes 24/168), and continues on beyond until it hits a wall. Even from where you are you can feel the incredible power of the spell, and yet the monstrosity barely flinches, (slowing only to change direction towards Leifr if he was not the original target.)

*How do you react?*
Note; players do not need to abide by initiative as this is not a combat phase. Whatever the players do the monstrosity remains focussed on Leifr, however it is surely not impossible for the players to come up with a situation wherein they may save Leifr. If this happens then allow Leifr to continue on an overwatch basis, remaining at HQ to provide support.

*If the players do not stop the Behir*; 
The monstrosity reaches Leifr and raises up off of its front legs. Leifr lifts his staff above his head and shouts "VON!" (Allies within 30ft) and Leifr himself are bathed in a restorative glow, a feeling of hopefulness fills your mind. Perhaps the beast can be beaten after all. 

Immediately, the beast grabs hold of Leifr and raises him off the ground, it's maw opens as wide as it can and Leifr is swallowed entirely. Then, almost as if nothing had happened it turns to (roll for target, odd = closest player, even = player that did the most damage), it's eyes ablaze with fury.

*Allow for player reactions*

***Though RAW state the Behir should throw up Leifr if it receives enough damage, DM fiat says that putting the players in a leading role will fit the theme better and so this rule is passed over for effect.***

Upon being swallowed Leifr uses the last charge on his Ring of Three Wishes. A perception roll (**Dc10**) may be used for nearby PCs to hear that words are spoken, but what words are garbled. With a very hard check(**DC20**), players within 5ft may hear the words *"If I must give my life to liberate this island from tyranny, then that is my wish"*. The ring then becomes non-magical. Using Wish causes the Behir to fall over dead with no apparent cause of death. Leifr dies inside the Behir.

With a passive perception (**DC8**), or if someone investigates the monstrosity (**DC2**) It may be noticed that one leg of the Behir is malformed and significantly shorter than the others due to having been tagged by a shipping label, stunting its growth. The label reads that it is a Halruuan Behir. With a Nature (**DC10**) or animal handling (**DC12**), or else prior understanding - It may be known that this variant of Behir is known as a miniature variety, selectively bred to be pets. This clearly is not a Halruuan Behir.

If players exhume the body and investigate the body they will find a note. Otherwise the note is found by the medic, a halfling female, when preparing the body.

Some time passes after the event, the other members from outside have pulled the supplies into the cavern now and a campfire has been set up around which the players sit to read the note.

The note reads;
"Francis Roberts, may this letter find you in the result of my death. You bring dishonor to your lineage, and to the name of my father, Ygerdern. That you can act a friend to this island for so many years and yet it all be deception, I feel for your daughter. 

Do not consider the taking of my life a victory, for in my stead I leave the task of liberation to my Lieutenants, each if them hand picked and more than capable of picking up wherever I left off. 

May you rot on this island.
-Leifr"

The players now have some time to introduce themselves and discuss what brought them to the rebellion and why they had been chosen as lieutenants under Leifr.

In the meantime a scout, more capable looking than any others in the group begins pulling together debris in order to make a sort of makeshift war table, complete with map.

**Part 3**:
An NPC has set up the war table, upon the table sits a [[Regions of the Island of Q'ba.png|map of the island]]. This map is highlighted per region and denotes on it potential starting points for liberation campaigns, one per region, including the city and port.

The head scout, a young-looking Green Dragon, offers the following information:
"Whilst we have the most basic of supplies covered, we sure won't be comfy. It could be nice for some stocking up, heading to the city would be a good idea, you can observe how things are there, maybe pick up on some information. Hopefully we will have a better report from the scouts when you get back? Otherwise we have some information that could do well for a starting point, but who knows what you might be getting into" the scout offers 100GP for any one player to take to cover basic needs. "Im afraid we will have to cover our own costs in the future, however"

His face turns to seriousness as he looks down to the map, pointing a finger to the northern region of the island. 

"Right, to business then. In no particular order:"

**The Northern Mountains** - The non-humans in the mines have not been seen for some time, might be worth going to see what's happening up there. We might be able to recruit some extra help too, we are going to need some improvements to our equipment at some point after all.
**The Eastern Marshes** - We know that the humans have begun terraforming in this area, and we've been getting reports of some wildlife getting aggressive, I hope they don't hurt anyone.
**The Southern desert** - Might be worth checking out the desert? It would sure be nice to bring back the storms and restore the power Garyx had out there. His followers would definitely be grateful for it if nothing else.
**The Western forests** - We haven't got much information about what we could do to help out in the west, maybe you could head on over to Kindlewood, it's the largest village in the area and there might be some assistance worth giving.
**The Port** - The port is the trade centre of the island, if we could remove The Crowns influence from the area. This would reduce his resources, and maybe we could even improve our own in the process. Of course this region is probably going to be heavily guarded we won't be able to just crash the place.
**The City** - Of course, this is the main area of Francis' power. It could be worth a scouting mission and we could certainly use supplies. As far as bringing down The Crown goes, I'm not sure what we'd do here except for rushing the castle...I have my doubts that would go too well though... unless you have a better plan?

**Players should choose a location for travel, and thus begin Act 2**

>[!note] Players should describe how they travel, and how to dress. Dressing in hooded outfits, or not washing after being covered in blood may lead to a random encounter by guards on the way to their destination who treat them suspiciously. Normal clothing would attract no such attention.
