(Verse 1)
On Q'ba's isle, where thunder doth crash, 
Through skies of fire, and waters that splash, 
Ygerdern ruled, with shimmering scale, 
A dragon king, with a story to hail. 
But years had dimmed, his fiery gaze, 
And death drew near, in a misty haze.

(Verse 2) 
From distant lands, a man did sail, 
Francis Roberts, with a scholar's tale, 
Of ancient lore and mystic art, 
Seeking knowledge, to set apart. 
He charmed the court with words of power, 
And promises of a brighter hour.

(Verse 3)
Ygerdern, weary, with failing sight, 
Saw Francis, bathed in mystic light, 
A scholar keen, on ancient lore, 
To unlock secrets, and learn of yore. 
He pledged his service, to the king's own hand, 
Yet Frank the Thorn, had other plans.

(Verse 4) 
The Dragonborn watched, with wary eyes, 
As Francis "Foreign", began to rise. 
His laws were harsh, his taxes high, 
Their ancient customs, he did defy. 
"Frank the Thorn," they hissed with scorn, 
But he held fast the crown he'd borne.

(Verse 5) 
He claimed the castle, towering high, 
Above the city, reaching for the sky. 
With shimmering scales, that shift and gleam, 
Reflecting sunlight, in a dazzling stream. 
But shadow fell, upon the shining walls, 
As fear and silence, filled the echoing halls.

(Verse 6) 
So sing this song, of Q'ba's plight,
Where dragons weep, in endless night. 
A human king, with iron hand, 
Rules the island, once so grand. 
But whispers rise, on the smoky breeze, 
Of vengeance vowed, on Frank's decrees.

May this ballad keep the spirit of resistance alive in the hearts of the Dragonborn and remind them of their strength and heritage!
