Ygerdern was a golden [[Dragonborn]], and a follower of [[Garyx]] as his father, [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta|Greenscale]] was before him. 

Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta is the son of the previous [[The Crown|Crown]], [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]]. Ygerdern was handed [[The Crown]] through [[Succession of The Crown|Succession]], though [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta|Draumur]] continued to live for a few years afterwards. Ygerdern was chosen by [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta|Greenscale]] due to being his heir, but moreso because of the bond that Ygerdern had formed with the leader of the [[Human|Humans]] who lived on the island, believing this to be a very useful characteristic for the next [[The Crown|Crown]].

10 years prior, the [[Human|Humans]] had first settled on [[Q'ba]] and now, the cooperation between [[Human]] and [[Dragonborn]] had led the island to a golden age of prosperity. Due to this Ygerdern chose to break from tradition when creating his council of [[The Three]], installing a fourth member; [[Francis Roberts]] - the leader of the [[Human|Humans]] who came to the island as part of a research expedition. 

Further advances on the island thanks to the [[Human|Humans]] understanding of technology, agriculture and healing led to greater bonding between Ygerdern and [[Francis Roberts]], eventually leading to Ygerdern passing [[The Crown]] to [[Francis Roberts]] upon his death 11 years ago. Ygerdern believed [[Francis Roberts|Francis]] to be a strong leader and ally, and fiercely loyal to the success of the island and all of it's people.
