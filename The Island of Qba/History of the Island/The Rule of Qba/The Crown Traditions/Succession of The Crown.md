[[The Crown]] is the ruler of the island of [[Q'ba]]. The succession of The Crown from one being to the next has famously few rules, the successor is merely whosoever is chosen by the previous [[The Crown|Crown]], and they have the liberty to chose this person however they chose. 

In recent history:
 - [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] succeeded to [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], his son.
 - [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]] succeeded to [[Francis Roberts]], his loyal friend and [[The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden|Councillor]].
