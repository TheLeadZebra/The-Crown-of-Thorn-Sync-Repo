The Council of The Crown is the name given to the advisors of [[The Crown]], the ruler of the island of [[Q'ba]]. Traditionally the council consists of three members, known as The Three. The individuals who make up The Three have no predefined rules or roles, at any time [[The Crown]] may choose to instate, remove or replace any member of The Three, and each member could take on a previous role or have a role completely unique to their tenure. 

For Example, within [[The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]] it is known that Thruumb Hugsi was given the title "Envoy to the Common Folk", to focus on [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern's]] aim of inclusing the common folk into his decision making, as well as providing them with as good a life as possible. By decree, however, [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]] had the right to remove Thruumb from this post and reinstate someone else to the position, or else create a new title altogether, for example if a greater focus on island security was now required.
