#### Recent Island History
The Island of [[Q'ba]], settled by [[Dragonborn]] many generations ago, they lived in peace. 

The island's geography is of particular note, despite it's size it is home to many biomes important to the [[Dragonborn]] - [[Astilabor's Peak|Icy mountains in the north]], [[Stillwater Mire|acid marshes spread from the eastern coastline]], [[The Desert|a scorching desert which is prone to blinding lightning storms sits the south]], and [[Dimmafall|densly packed forest in the West]]. 

The [[Dragonborn]] have set up a dense city off centre of the island, [[Drakenholm]], a well packed city, with buildings rising in height accross the districts, starting low at the entrance and rising, with wealth, towards the main keep, [[The Castle]]. A tall structure with scale-like walls denoting the power of those that sit within it's halls. 

Though it is that a [[Dragonborn]] [[The Crown|Emporer]] that once sat on this throne, this title has been handed down to [[Human|Humankind]]. The power the [[Human|Humankind]] now have over the island was given willingly by the [[Dragonborn]], for the his council was great, their trust earned. 

The nature of the island's regions is that which originally drew the humans to the island, such biomes, all important to the [[Dragonborn]], on such a small island was not impossible but was considered highly improbable. The [[Human|humans]], always interested in claiming strength, considered that these biomes are unlikely to be natural, but such terraforming would require immense power, or knowledge now lost to time. The [[Dragonborn]] that inhabit this island do not hold the idea of history high in their minds, instead focussing their energy on devotion to the deities, beheld by them based on their elemental affinities. 

Though the [[Dragonborn]] are loyal to their own, upon the passing of the crown from Emperor [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]] it was the [[Human]], [[Francis Roberts]]; known as "*The Foreigner*", who was granted the glory of rule. This decision was made with no uncertainty and few slighted Francis - now King. The nickname bestowed upon him, The Foreigner, could easily be mistaken as an insult, pointing out that he is not one from this land but, in fact, it is the opposite; that all he does for this land and for it's people are despite this not being the homeland of [[Francis Roberts]]. [[Francis Roberts|King Francis]] was chosen by [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]] because of his loyalty to the [[Dragonborn]] people and offered the title King as a sign of great respect for the lands the humans once called home. 

Though new to the island, the expedition of [[Human|humans]] to the island of [[Q'ba]] had brought many prosperities. The [[Human|humans]] shared their knowledge of crop rotations, disease control and skills in territorial expansion to increase the lifestyle of the [[Dragonborn]], improving the islands' self sufficiency and strengthening their faith with the elements. The [[Human|humans]], too, prospered. With the same such knowledge that they passed down to the [[Dragonborn]], [[Human|humans]] expanded to villages spread across the island and their population boomed. 

[[Francis Roberts|King Francis]] was [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern's]] closest and most trusted advisor. [[Francis Roberts|King Francis]] is a wizard, a skilled student of magic, whose research on the island was very personal. It was this loyalty to the island, and that of [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]] which led to the decision of [[Succession of The Crown|Succession]], not to his son, [[Leifr Funahjarta]], but to [[Francis Roberts|Francis]], despite [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr's]] leadership qualities.

As [[The Crown]], [[Francis Roberts|Francis]] did not act as he did before. [[Francis Roberts|King Francis]], once revered for his love of [[Dragonborn]], began his reign of oppression. All Dragonborn who once called themselves [[The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden||Crown Advisor]] were removed from the castle, replaced by high ranking [[The Council of King Francis Roberts|human commanders]]. Taxes were steadily increased for [[Dragonborn]] specific goods, both traded and imported, on top of increases in payments for market stools and trade houses. These alone led to a financial depression of [[Dragonborn]] folk, and an increase in debt from [[Dragonborn]] to those of [[Human|Humankind]].  Quickly, [[Dragonborn]] who were able left the island, but such a sudden depression led to a stranding of many folk on [[Q'ba]]. 

In less than a decade, the [[Dragonborn]] went from a glorious island nation, to merely workers for a parasite species who stood over them. One the [[Dragonborn]] had called friend. 

# Island Biography

Though this is the story of [[Human]] and [[Dragonborn]], there of course exist small communities of other races who, for some reason or other, have their own reason for existing on [[Q'ba]]. Take, for example the [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] and [[Goblin|Goblins]] who live among the hills and mountains in the north, abundant with resources, deep filles with ores and gemstones. [[Dryad|Dryads]] call the Eastern Forests their home, cultivated by travelling [[Elf|Elven]] druids who visited the islands, leaving the [[Dryad|Seeds of Dryads]] behind. Besides those who have made themselves a permanent home, the humans developed the main docks of the island to become a trading port now called [[Kin's Landing]] which bustles with sailing folk of all races who stop at the port for rest from [[Far-off Lands]] to restock, trade and for entertainment. 

# Island Deities

The native [[Dragonborn]] have their own gods on the island, known as [[The Four Cardinal Gods]].

Each of [[The Four Cardinal Gods|The Four]] rule over a region of the island:
- [[Astilabor]] - [[Astilabor's Peak]]
- [[Garyx]] - [[The Desert]]
- [[Null]] - [[Stillwater Mire]]
- [[Tamara]] - [[Dimmafall]]

In recent history the island has also been blessed with the presence of [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]] also, known here as [[The Binary Gods]].

The [[Human|Humans]] also brought with them their own god, [[Ilmatar]], who stands for them as a beacon of hard work despite pain or difficulty. This symbolism has been corrupted by many as justification for exploiting the [[Dragonborn]] and other [[Non-Human List|Non-Humans]] of the island.
