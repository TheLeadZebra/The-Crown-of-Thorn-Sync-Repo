For a map of the Island, see [[Map of Q'ba|here]]. The Island of Q'ba is home to [[Dragonborn]] as a native species, as well as a few other races who have settled upon the island in small numbers over the most recent few hundred years. These races are now split into their own categories of [[Human|Human]] who are very recent settlers, and [[Non-Human List]] which includes any sentient race that is neither [[Dragonborn]] or [[Human]]. 

The island itself is geographically not very large, and yet contains a wide range of biomes (Frost bound mountains, Acid Marshes, Luscious Forest and Scorching Desert) which split among the cardinal directions of the island. Each of these four directions is it's own [[Regions of Q'ba|Region]], as well as the island's city, [[Drakenholm]], and it's trade port, [[Kin's Landing]], each being designated their own region.

Q'ba is an independent state, complete with it's own ruler - [[The Crown]], currently [[Francis Roberts|King Francis Roberts]] who was in charge of a research expedition of [[Human|Humans]] to the island around 40 years ago. This was the first known contact with humans for the island, who were accepted as settlers on the island by [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]]. Since this time there has been a significant sharing of technology and knowledge, in areas such as building, farming and medicine. This lead to a boom in habitant capacity across the island, especially for the [[Human|Humans]] who now make up the largest portion of population on the island, overtaking even the [[Dragonborn]].

Q'ba is also known by it's population for the large variety of homebrewed or imported alcoholic beverages, with each region having their own, distinct menus, including each district of [[Drakenholm]]. Further to this, the whole island comes together to serve the same special option, which changes daily.
