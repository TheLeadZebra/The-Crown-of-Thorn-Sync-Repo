The mountain of Astilabor's Peak rises high over all else on the island of [[Q'ba]], dwarfing even [[The Castle]] in the city of [[Drakenholm]]. This mountain is found within the island's region of [[Astilabor's Peak]], attuned with the element of cold, and the domain of the [[List of Deities]] [[Astilabor]]. 

The mountain and it's surrounding landscape are covered with a layer of snow and ice all year round, and it is known that the area is abound with precious gems and metals which are mined by [[Dwarf|Dwarves]] and [[Goblin|Goblins]]. 

At the foot of the southern face of the mountain is the village of [[Astilabor's Claw]], as well as the mine known as [[Astilabor's Tail]].
