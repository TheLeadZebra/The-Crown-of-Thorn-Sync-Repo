<U>Information</u>
Draxis "Drax" Bhann is a green [[Dragonborn]], commanding the power of poison. 

A Childhood friend of [[Leifr Funahjarta]], Drax was at hand when [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]] decided that it was time to leave the city due to the growing tension between [[Dragonborn]] and [[Human]] kinds.

Drax had always been skilled at reading maps and orienterring or exploring and has since been invaluable regarding [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr's]] movements and coving tracks. This is not to say that Drax has been by his side the whole time. [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]] recently risked entering the city to find Drax and recruit him, citing the formation of a movement under his watch - that they had found a number of skilled individuals who were willing to try and make a difference on the island. Some he even believed to hold promise of leadership themselves one day, whom he called upon to be his lieutenants. 

<u>He has a story he can tell the players:</u> Of the time me and Leifr had a potions class. We loved alchemy classes, and being of noble backgrounds the twi of us were fortunate to be tutored by one of the most powerful alchemists in the land...no longer around unfortunately, however I remember us having homework to create a polymorph potion. We attempted it together round his (Leifr's). Upon completing the recipe the liquid inside began to shimmer with many different colours, it seemed like the potion had worked. So excited he was to show his father, [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]], that he stumbled and spilled some of the potion from the flask onto the family cat! I don't know if you've ever seen a Hippopotamus try to curl up into a cat bed but it seemed like the saddest hour of that animal's life...
