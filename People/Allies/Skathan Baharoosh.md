<U>Information</u>
Skathan and [[Tiberin Baharoosh|Tiberin]] are twins brothers.

Skathan is a Brass [[Dragonborn]], commanding the power of fire. His weapon of choice is a Maul.

Skathan and [[Tiberin Baharoosh|Tiberin]] were recruited to the cause by [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]].
While living in [[Ravenstone Bridge]] they worked the nearby farmland, their parents indebted to humans that owned the land, the boys took on the duty of paying off this debt themselves. 

One day, [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]] himself was spotted by King's guard patrolling through the town and attempted to imprison him. Though the boys did not recognise [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]], they jumped to the aid of a fellow [[Dragonborn]] and, managing to surprise the guards were able to defeat them. The battle was a tough one and showed that, though they had no training, the boys had a natural affinity for the fight and were willing to put their own lives on the line to help a stranger.

Having witnessed this scene, [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]] provided the twins with the means to find him should they ever be interested in joining his cause.

Just a few weeks after this event, the twins returned home from a day of farming to find their family home burned down. Their mother had been pulled from the building by a neighbor, but their father was still inside. Unfortunately neither parent survived the ordeal.
The neighbor pointed out the arsonist as the son of the human family that the Baharoosh brothers owed money to, who started the fire with a group of 4 others.

The boys were easy to track down and were little comparison to the men from the King's guard the weeks prior. The Baharoosh twins knew after that, they would not be able to rebuild their life as it was, and so decided to take Leifr up on his offer.

After the event with the landowner's son [[Tiberin Baharoosh|Tiberin]] and Skathan headed towards the forest to lie low before meeting up with [[Leifr Funahjarta|Leifr]]. At this time [[Tiberin Baharoosh|Tiberin]] bumped into [[Malvanita Whispersun]] who tended to his wounds. The cause would likely need a healer, and after agreeing on their feelings towards [[Human|Humans]] she decided that she would follow them to join the rebellion.
