<U>Information</u>
Malvanita 'Vanity' Whispersun is a druidic Halfling hailing from [[Dimmafall]].

One of the few non-[[Elf|elven]] members of the [[Circle of the Shepherd]] that inhabit the forest in the west, Vanity was trained by the circle to perform basic medical tasks. Whilst she has spent some time learning the art of medicine, there was very little field work involved within the Circle and therefore, she has a good amount of theoretical knowledge and yet very little practical experience.

Vanity has an affinity for the creatures that live on the island, especially within the forest, and has been searching for a way to push back against the human encrochment of land on the island and their hostility toward the native population. 

Recruited by [[Tiberin Baharoosh]] who passed her in the forest injured after his fight with a landowner's son. They spent the time discussing his story and their feelings towards the humans, leading to [[Tiberin Baharoosh|Tiberin]] asking Malvanita to come along and help out, he was sure that a healer would be useful to the group and it would be a great oppurtunity for Malvanita to improve her skills in the art.
