<U>Information</u>
Lohtaris is a young adult Dwarven Bard, known for drumming along to the songs she sings, often with a wooden spoon on a surface, whilst cooking up a hearty meal.

Lohtaris hails from the mountainous [[Astilabor's Peak|Northern Region]] of the island, who spent her years working in the mines around [[Astilabor's Peak]] with many of her Dwarven brethren. Though it was not often that she joined them in the mining itself she was always on hand to provide a good lunch for the hardworking folk. 

In the early days of her cooking she spent a lot of time focused on preparing the food but over time it became second nature, her love for the food then turned into song and it was often many of the worker's favourite part of the day to visit Lohtaris to collect some food and hear her singing a tune and drumming along with her wooden spoon. 

On days when Lohtaris joined in the mining she was often the first one to start up a workers song, with Dwarves often syncing their pickaxe swings to coincide with the rhythm of the song. Hearing the 'tinking' along was always Lohtaris' favourite part of the work.

On her way back to town her group were ambushed by a gang of hooded individuals. Though it was never confirmed Lohtaris believes them to have been Humans. Lohtaris was the only one who survived the attack. Dazed and stumbling she got lost in a nearby forested area, and, seeing the dim glow of a small fire in the distance, happened upon a camp that Leifr had set up. 

Fortune must have favored her that day as his abilities as a healer saved her life, to this day she feels she has not repayed her debt....and now she never will.
