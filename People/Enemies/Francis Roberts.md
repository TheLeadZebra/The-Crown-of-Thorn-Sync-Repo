King Francis Roberts, a human and often known as 'The Foreign' as a term of endearment, is the current [[The Crown|Crown]] of the island of [[Q'ba]], and the first non-[[Dragonborn]] to hold the title. He is a powerful wizard and the leader of a [[Human]] research expedition which settled on the island over 40 years ago, granted the right to live on the island by [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta]] who was [[The Crown]] at the time. No findings have been published on their research to this date.

As the leader of the [[Human]] group on the island, he spent a lot of time in discussion with [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta|Greenscale]] and his son, [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta]], with a lot of technological knowlege shared from the [[Human|Humans]] to the island folk. Being closer in age to [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern]] than [[Draumur 'Greenscale' Funahjarta|Draumur]], a strong bond formed between the two of them and shortly after [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern's]] [[Succession of The Crown|Succession]], Francis was admitted to [[The Council of Emperor Ygerdern the Golden]], breaking a tradition of the island to form a council of only three members, known as [[The Three]]. 

This position only strengthened the friendship between Francis and [[Ygerdern 'the Golden' Funahjarta|Ygerdern the Golden]], eventually leading to Francis being chosen as the next [[The Crown|Crown]] of the island, 11 years ago. A year later, Francis performed his first act that would begin a chain of events, eventually turning his reputation from that of a once revered leader, into a ruthless tyrant. 

The first insance was a raising of taxes for all [[Non-Human List|non-humans]] on the island, including the [[Dragonborn]]. At the same time he installed his own [[The Council of King Francis Roberts|Council]], defying the tradition of [[The Three]] in it's entirety. 6 years ago, in response to agression from [[Non-Human List|Non-humans]] the council was relabelled as ***Peacekeepers***. 

Francis has proven himself indifferent to the suffering of [[non-Human List|non-humans]] and has done nothing to reduce aggression toward them from [[Human|humans]], even going as far as to encourage the damage or destruction of temples to [[Q'ba's Draconic Pantheon|Draconic deities]] deemed 'evil' or 'sinful'.

In the last 10 years his nickname 'The Foreign' has been distorted into an insult, and [[The Ballad of Frank the Thorn]] as a now infamous bards tale, now very much banned from performance across the island.
