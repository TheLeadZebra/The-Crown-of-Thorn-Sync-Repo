The Pub is the name of the Tavern and Inn in the [[Old Town]] district of [[Drakenholm]]. 

The Pub should be described as you would describe an English Pub. The barkeep is a Human man who has absolutely no passion for the job.

The only drinks availible here are:
- Ale - What brand? Ale.
- Ale Flip - What makes it an ale flip? It costs 3 silver to find out. Upon payment the barkeep pours a mug of Ale, then pulls out a bucket, and flips the mug over the bucket. The barkeep then wipes splashes from the side of the bar and slides the empty mug towards the patron.

The Pub also houses an Inn, the rooms here are... adequete, but are adequetely cheap.
