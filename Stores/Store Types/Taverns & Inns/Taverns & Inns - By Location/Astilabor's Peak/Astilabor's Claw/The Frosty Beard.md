Clearly a play on the region's anthropological nomenclature, The Frosty Beard is the name of the [[Tavern or Inn|Inn]] in the town of [[Astilabor's Claw]], within the region of [[Astilabor's Peak]].
The building resembles a ramshackle log cabin, yet with a grand scale. Inside features a single room designed with warmth in mind, yet all other areas of the building inspire a feeling of the element of cold, which may be uninviting to races that are uncomfortable in the cold.

A gambling hall is also available here which switched out the event nightly between dice games, card games and arena contests of might or skill.

The bartender here is a [[Goblin]] [DM note: Imagine a Sarah Millican voice], who has a bubbly attitude and likes to play along with jokes, whilst forcing her way into conversations. They are keen to share information, yet their obvious inability to be subtle means that people often do not share openly with her, thus her potential for helpfulness may not be equivalent to her capacity to be keen.
