Free Borough is a district of [[Drakenholm]]. Sitting between [[Beggars Gate]] and [[Old Town]], and running alongside [[Dragonhill Mile]], Free Borough is the central hub of temples and guilds. All of the island [[List of Deities|deities]] have their own temple in the city, as well as any number that exist within their designated [[The Four Cardinal Gods|regions]] across [[Q'ba]].

During times of civil unrest within the last decade, temples to deities considered to align with negative traits within this city have been targeted with assaults and vandalism.
