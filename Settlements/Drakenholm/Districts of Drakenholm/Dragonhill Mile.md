Dragonhill Mile is a district of [[Drakenholm]] which runs up the centre of the city, connecting [[Beggars Gate]] and the [[Military District]] directly. Though on an incline, this part of the city houses the wealthiest of [[Nobles]] with the most grandiose houses, though they lack the height of the housing in the [[Upper Quarters|White Gardens]] district.
