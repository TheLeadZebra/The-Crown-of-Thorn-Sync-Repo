The Binary Gods are [[Bahamut]] and [[Tiamat]], who brought their presence to the island of [[Q'ba]] after a [[Civil War]] within the city of [[Drakenholm]]. 

Though they are more powerful than any of [[The Four Cardinal Gods]] individually, their hold on the island is far less impressive, which much of their focus elsewhere. This however, does not mean those who worship the Binary Gods are small in number, as many on the island recognise the gods of the island as a whole rather than the smaller number who choose a favoured Deity and dedicate themselves wholey towards them. 

The Binary Gods each have their own temple within the [[Free Borough]], as with the other gods of the island.
